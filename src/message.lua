	Every week, this balance will be updated to reflect various incoming revenue and outgoing expenses.
	Revenue includes things such as sponsorship income, ticket sales, merchandise sales, and competition prize money.
	Expenses includes things such as player wages, staff wages, facilities upkeep, and general operational costs.

	The Board are flexible with regards to the way you wish to manage the budget provided, as long as the club meets its seasonal targets and does not fall into debt.

	In the event the club does fall into debt (The budget becomes negative), the board will provide a cash injection to keep the club operating. We will be entirely disappointed if this does occur, and will likely review your position at the club. We would like to stress that the cash injection should be seen as a last-resort measure, and you should attempt any course of action necessary to prevent this from occuring.

	We will contact you twice throughout the season regarding our financial report of the club. The first of these reports will occur halfway through the season, with the second coming just before the end-of-season performance review. These will summarise our thoughts on the financial state of the club.

	You now have the chance to amend these targets, if you wish.
	If you wish to reduce the targets outlined above, this will not only disappoint the board and fans, but also reduce your available budget amongst other possible penalties.
	If you wish to increase the targets outlined above, the board will be happy as will the fans, and may lead to a slight budget increase, but note that failing to reach these higher goals will be considered unacceptable and may lead to further penalties at the end-of-season performance review.

	Once these targets have been set, The Board will not allow you to change them again during the season.
