	Exceeding the targets will be considered a bonus and may be rewarded at the end of the season.
	You now have the chance to amend these targets, if you wish.
	If you wish to reduce the targets outlined above, this will not only disappoint the board and fans, but also reduce your available budget amongst other possible penalties.
	If you wish to increase the targets outlined above, the board will be happy as will the fans, and may lead to a slight budget increase, but note that failing to reach these higher goals will be considered unacceptable and may lead to further penalties at the end of the season performance review.

	Once these targets have been set, The Board will not allow you to change them again during the season.
